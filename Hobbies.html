        <p>Hobbies and Interests: In recent years, I have taken up running as a way to challenge myself both physically and mentally. What started as a casual hobby soon became a passion, and last year, I achieved a major milestone by completing my first 10K race. The sense of accomplishment and motivation from that experience has driven me to push even further, and this year, I have taken on an even greater challenge by entering the Scottish Half Marathon. Training for this event has been both demanding and rewarding, and I am excited to test my endurance and continue progressing in my running journey.
