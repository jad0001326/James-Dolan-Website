            <p>
                In recent years, I have taken up running as a way to challenge myself both physically and mentally. 
                What started as a casual hobby soon became a passion, and last year, I achieved a major milestone

                has driven me to push even further.

                Strathcarron 10K Race 2024
            </a>. 
            Training for this event has been both demanding and rewarding, and I am excited to test my endurance 
            and continue progressing in my running journey.
